20)Why is a stack called a LAST-IN FIRST-OUT data structure?:A:Because the last item added will be the last one that will be removed,B:Because the last item added will be the first one that will be removed,C:Because the first item added will be the first one that will be removed,D:Because the first item added will be the last one that will be removed.
